## Abstract

This interactive short course will introduce how to analyze categorical survey data in R. We will cover the R functions needed to create the survey design object to account for the sampling design, obtain weighted proportions from survey data, and conduct chi-sq tests and simple linear regression models. Throughout the course, you will get hands-on experience using data from the American National Election Studies. We will be using Posit Cloud, so you do not need to have R or RStudio preinstalled on your computer. For the best learning experience, we recommend you have prior experience with R and the tidyverse, including familiarity with summarize() and group_by().
