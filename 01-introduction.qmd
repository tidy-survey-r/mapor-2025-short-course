Each of us give a brief intro on our experience/background
:::

## Background {.smaller}

- This tutorial largely builds off our book written with Stephanie Zimmer (RTI): Exploring Complex Survey Data Analysis Using R
  - <https://tidy-survey-r.github.io/site/>
- The book covers additional topics outside this tutorial including:
  - Overview of survey process
  - Linear regression and logistic regression
  - Communication of results (tables and plots)
  - Reproducible research best practices

- Not covered
   - Weighting (calibration, post-stratification, raking, etc.)
   - Survival analysis
   - Nonlinear models

## Motivation

- We are R users who work with survey data regularly
- We wanted to share knowledge with
  - R users who are inaccurately analyzing survey data
  - SAS/SUDAAN/Stata users who may not know about the capabilities of R
- {srvyr} package developed using tidyverse style syntax

## Prerequisites

**Tidyverse familiarity**

::: {.incremental}
- Selecting a set of variables (`select(starts_with("TOT"))`)
- Creating new variables with `mutate()`
- Summarizing data with `summarize()`
- Using `group_by()` with `summarize()` to create group summaries
:::

## Overview of tutorial

- At the end of this tutorial, you should be able to 
   - Calculate point estimates and their standard errors with survey data 
      - Proportions, totals, and counts
   - Perform chi-squared tests
   - Conduct regression
   - Specify a survey design in R to create a survey object
   
## Roadmap for today

  - Getting started
  - Descriptive analysis
  - Statistical testing
  - Modeling
  - Sampling design

## Logistics

  - We will be using Posit Cloud for exercises 
  - All materials are found at:
    - <https://tidy-survey-r.github.io/mapor-2025-short-course/> (Site)
